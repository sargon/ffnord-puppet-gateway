# table exports it routes to the mesh table and import

# peers from here routes to local subnets are communicated 
# and routes to other communities from icvpn peers in the local
# network are exchanged.

# If this router is a icvpn peer then routes from the
# icvpn will be exchanged directly with the mesh table.
